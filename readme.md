Design Decisions for Web Application



## Introduction



### The web application was designed and developed to allow users to request different Astronomy Pictures of the Day by date using the NASA APOD API. Users could also save pictures as favorites. The design decisions made were based on the following considerations:



## User Experience



### The user experience was the primary consideration for the design. The web application was designed to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide a clear call-to-action. The design aimed to communicate the message of the application, the available features, and how to use them.



## Branding



### The design was made using Penpot, a web-based design and prototyping tool. The branding and visual identity of the web application were based on a space theme. The colors, fonts, and imagery used were consistent with the space theme and the NASA APOD API.



## Responsive Design



### The web application was designed to be responsive, meaning it could adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The design ensured that the content was easily accessible and legible across all devices.



## Accessibility



### The design also took into account accessibility considerations. The use of high-contrast colors, large and legible fonts, and keyboard navigation ensured that the web application was accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.



## Design Elements



### The following design elements were used in the web application:



## Landing Page



### The landing page was the first thing that visitors saw when they landed on the website. The design used a large background image with a prominent call-to-action button that directed users to the main content of the web application. The landing page also included a form that allowed users to request Astronomy Pictures of the Day by date.



## Astronomy Picture of the Day Page



### The Astronomy Picture of the Day page displayed the requested Astronomy Picture of the Day along with the title, date, and explanation. Clicking on the image opened the high definition version of the image. The page also included a button that allowed users to save the picture as a favorite.



## Favorites Page



### The Favorites page displayed the saved favorite pictures in a grid view. The page included a button that allowed users to delete a favorite picture.



## Navigation



### The web application included a navigation bar that allowed users to switch between the Landing Page, Astronomy Picture of the Day Page, and Favorites Page.



## Conclusion



### The design of the web application aimed to provide a seamless user experience while communicating the features and benefits of the application. The use of a space theme and high-quality imagery created a visually appealing interface that was easy to navigate and use. The responsive design and accessibility considerations ensured that the web application was accessible to all users.
